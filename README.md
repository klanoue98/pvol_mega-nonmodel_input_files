# Pvol mega-nonmodel Input Files

The purpose of this repository is to record the creation of files needed to run Eric Anderson's mega-non-model-wgs-snakemake-workflow (git@github.com:eriqande/mega-non-model-wgs-snakeflow.git). 

The files needed for input include the following:
- units.tsv
- chromosomes.tsv
- scaffolds.tsv
- config.yaml
- config.yaml (seperate yaml for running on slurm)

Eric has some great examples and helper scripts to make the above files, but I found that my de novo genome needed some customization in the helper scripts.
